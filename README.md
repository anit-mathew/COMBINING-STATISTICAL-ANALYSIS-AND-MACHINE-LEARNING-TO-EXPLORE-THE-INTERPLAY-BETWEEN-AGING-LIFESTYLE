# COMBINING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING TO EXPLORE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN AGING, LIFESTYLE CHOICES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, AND BRAIN STROKES

As the global population ages, the impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) on the elderly has become a critical concern in public health. This research project delves into the incidence, risk factors, and prevention strategies related to heart disease, high blood pressure, and brain strokes in older individuals.

# Research Focus:

# Grading factors influencing strokes across different age groups.
Analyzing oversampled data to identify consistent patterns using various models (Logistic, Decision Tree, DNN, and Random Forest).
Examining lifestyle factors such as smoking habits, BMI, and other variables in the context of CVDs and strokes.

# Objectives: 

Understand the relationships between aging, lifestyle choices, and cardiovascular diseases.
Address fundamental questions related to the incidence and impact of CVDs and strokes in the elderly.
Provide valuable insights for public health, elderly care, and policy development.

# Expected Outcomes:

Identification of high-risk groups within the elderly population.
Understanding how lifestyle factors contribute to the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and strokes.
Policy recommendations for targeted interventions and preventive measures.

# How to Use This Repository:

The repository is organized into chapters covering literature review, data collection, and analysis, results, and discussions.
Code implementations for various models and data analysis are provided in the respective files.
The findings and recommendations can be explored to gain insights into mitigating the impact of CVDs on the aging global community.

Thank you for visiting, and we invite collaboration and contributions to advance the understanding of cardiovascular health in older adults.
